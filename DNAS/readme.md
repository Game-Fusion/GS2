# DNAS Servers

DNAS (Dynamic Network Access System) is the networking service used by the GameStation 2. If the developer so wishes, they can use these servers for many uses, including:

- Authenticating valid or pirated copies of a game.

- Connectivity between different games (eg. linking two games together with one DNAS server so statistics or usernames can be shared).

- Easy control of the current status of their games - universal online, offline and shutdown messages that work across any games using DNAS.

The client code can be run on a real GS2 to connect to a computer with the sample server code running. Developers are encouraged to expand upon this code and make their own custom DNAS servers for their games.
