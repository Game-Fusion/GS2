Guide to networking on the GS2
written by Mr_Iron2.

-----

The GS2 is known for, among other things,
its ambitious forays into servers and
networking at launch. It tried everything
from a game distribution platform to a game
streaming service (which is now used in
Revolution's Shield device) and even the
famous DNAS system, an optional authentication
server which games can pass through.

DNAS

DNAS (Dynamic Network Authentication Service)
is a GS2 service which games can pass through
to get information about the GS2 and/or to
authenticate games connecting to servers or P2P.
To send a request to the DNAS servers, simply
do the following:

  local modem = peripheral.find("modem")
  modem.open(661)
  modem.transmit(661, 661, {sType = "status"})
  
This sends a status request to the DNAS servers
to check whether DNAS is still online, temporarily
down or permanently terminated. Simple, right?

DNAS also has a utility, which can be found on
the GS2 GitHub page, as well as a Network Center
program so you can configure and test your
connection to DNAS. Handy!
